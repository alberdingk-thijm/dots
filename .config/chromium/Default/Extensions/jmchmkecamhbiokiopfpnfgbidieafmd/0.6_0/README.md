# Chrome Markdown Extension

Automatically parses markdown files (.md) into HTML. This is useful
if you're writing markdown (ultimately targeting HTML) and want a quick
preview.


# Usage

1. Install extension from [webstore][] (creates no new UI)
2. Check "Allow access to file URLs" in `chrome://extensions` listing: ![fileurls](http://i.imgur.com/qth3K.png)
3. Open local or remote .md file in Chrome.
4. See nicely formatted HTML!
